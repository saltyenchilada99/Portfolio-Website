	<div class = "subsection"><p>Welcome! My name is Matthew Weber, a junior at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science.
	My career goals include mastery in web development and software engineering, as well as joining a team that pushes
	the limits of digital innovation. Other strengths include mathematics and GUI design. Outside of the classroom I 
	enjoy volleyball, music, and video games. The purpose of this continuously built-upon website is to allow employers 
	to know me better as an individual, as well as see some demonstration on my web-programming knowledge</p></div>

		<p>As a part of my responsive web design certification, I was required to create a tribute page honoring someone's life.
		The template I created with this page was a big inspiration to the template I used on the procedures of my operator's manual
		website. The smooth fade-in, fade-out transitions of the text was completed by using javascript to transition the positions 
		of each text-box and image</p>

		<p>In the summer of 2024, I worked at H&K group, a construction company located in the northeast region. I teamed up with
		their block and supply division to design a physical and digital operator's manual for incoming new construction workers
		as a reference on how to safely and effectively handle the operating machines throughout the construction site. I designed
		the website with idea of keeping the layout simple and concise, to make the user-experience beginner-friendly to new-workers
		while maintaining the H&K design style of a heavy-duty construction aesthetic</p>
