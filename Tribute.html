			<p>The president's first attempt to stop nuclear tensions in Cuba was an aggressive tactic that would go on to be known as
			the Bay of Pigs invasion. The invasion attempt was unsuccessful leaving 114 soldiers dead and the rest imprisoned. Later in 1962
			the Kennedy administration found out that nuclear missile sites were being built in Cuba, marking a high point in the cold war.
			This would go on to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, consisting of naval tensions between Cuba and the United States. After
			two weeks stalling, the U.S government made a deal with Cuba to dismantle the missile sites with the promise of the Cuba not being attacked
			by its neighbor from the north
